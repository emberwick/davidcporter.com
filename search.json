But the Qing empire was built and held together by a single imperial elite: the more than two million members of the hereditary Eight Banner system who were at the core of both the military and the bureaucracy. The banner population was multiethnic, linked by shared membership in a clearly demarcated status group defined in law and administrative practice. Banner people were bound to the court by an exchange of loyal service for institutionalized privilege, a relationship symbolically conceptualized as one of slave to master.\n\n\n\nSlaves of the Emperor explores the Qing approach to one of the fundamental challenges of early modern state-building: how to develop an effective bureaucracy with increasing administrative capacity to govern a growing polity while retaining the loyalty of the ruling family’s most important supporters. David C. Porter traces how the banner system created a service elite through its processes of incorporating new members, its employment of bannermen as technical specialists, its imposition of service obligations on women as well as men, and its response to fiscal and ideological challenges. Placing Qing practices in comparative perspective, he uncovers crucial parallels to similar institutions in Tokugawa Japan, imperial Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. Slaves of the Emperor provides a new framework for understanding the structure and function of elites both in China and elsewhere in Eurasia in the early modern period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeer-reviewed articles\n“Bannermen as Translators: Manchu Language Education in the Hanjun Banners.” Late Imperial China 40.2 (December 2019), pp. 1-43.\n“Manchu Racial Identity on the Qing Frontier: Donjina and Early Twentieth-Century Ili.” Modern China 44.1 (January 2018), pp. 3-34.\n\n\nBook reviews\nSöderblom Saarela, Mårten.

My first book, Slaves of the Emperor: Service, Privilege, and Status in the Qing Eight Banners (Columbia, 2024), explores the history of one of the key institutions of the Manchu conquest of China – the Eight Banner System.\nMy current book project is a study of translation and translators and their role in the Qing state, in which I aim to explain the critical role that translation played in the Qing state, from the routine use of bilingual documents in everyday administration to the role of Inner Asian languages in frontier expansion and governance, and to upend the belief that translators were a marginalized group relative to graduates of the civil exam system.\n\n\nEducation\nHarvard University | Cambridge, MA\nPhD in History and East Asian Languages | May 2018\nYale University | New Haven, CT\nB.A. in History | May 2010"
